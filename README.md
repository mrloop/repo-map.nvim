# repo-map.nvim

Create a repo map of most used files and symbol in a directory. Useful for providing context to Large Language Models, LLM, where the context window is too small to send all your code. This module is intented for use in nvim plugins that interact with LLM such as code assistants or auto complete. Inspired by aider.chat please take a look at there [blog post about how they use a repo map](https://aider.chat/2023/10/22/repomap.html)
